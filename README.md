# DNA Non Emptiness
Amit Kol and Alexander Ar-Staelin's implenetation of the Non-Emptiness algorithm for deterministic numbered automata. <br>
This project is part of the workshop <b>Program Verification via Finite State Automata</b> given by Prof. Muli Safra during spring semester, 2016, in Tel Aviv University. <br>
The code should be compiled with a simple javac *.java. <br>
Please note that it accepts its input from stdin, so it should be run `java NonEmpty < inputfile`.
